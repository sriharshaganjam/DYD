concerns
-
The term customer would describe someone who would
wish to purchase or sell a product/products/product
catalogue/collection on the client website
-

Though most customers raise basic concerns which
results in a lower turnaround time, there are some
wherein sellers would like to understand how they can
expand their business and ultimately achieve a higher
revenue and profit. This is where a lot of research and
analytical skills come into the picture which helps in
providing a very satisfactory resolution to sellers the
goal here is to get business on a regular interval from
the customers
-

Patience a key aspect of the job. Not all customers are
satisfied with a resolution which is provided though it is
as per the policies/guidelines laid down by the client. To
be able to handle such situations by keeping calm and
at the same time convincing the customer about the
resolution provided
-

Retention It is very important to be aware of the policies
laid down by the client and also be aware of any product
updates which come from the client. Effectively,
absorbing and retaining content delivered throughout the
training period and clear assessments conducted during
that particular period
-

Flexibility Individuals should be flexible to work in a 24/7
environment. Though we try our best to provide shifts
which are rotating on a monthly basis, however based
on the business requirements, they would also be
expected to work in consecutive night shifts, say 3-4
months

Multitasking It would be expected that 3-4 chats would
need to be handled at any given point of time, where the
nature of the queries would vary from one another and
the resolution needs to be provided without consuming
too much time of the customer ",2025
